## Event Generator

Here are the generators in plain Pythia8 for the signal and the background.

To compile the code, run the Makefile. Two executables will be generated:

* signal
* background

One generates the signal photons, in the file signal_photons.root, and the
other generates the background photons, in the background_photons.root.

Makefile downloads and compiles Pythia8. Needs root environment variables
loaded.
