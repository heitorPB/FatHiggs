## Data Analysis

Here is the code to analyses the datasets created earlier.

To compile the code, run the Makefile and the executable myHiggs.

It will read files ../1/signal_photons.root and ../1/background_photons.root
and produce a myHiggs_mass.root with the invariant mass from signal and from
background.
