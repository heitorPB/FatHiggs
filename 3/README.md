## Histogram

Here is the code to plot the results and fit the data..

To compile the code, run the Makefile and the executable histoHiggs.

It will read file ../2/myHiggs_mass.root and produce a pdf and png with
the histogram.

The files FatHiggs_fake_bg_xsect.{pdf, png} were created with background 
cross section set to 6.2 fb.
